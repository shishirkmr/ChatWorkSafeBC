Risk identification and assessment\\nWorkers exposed to flour dust are at risk of health effects such as occupational asthma, respiratory sensitization, and allergy to flour dust. Flour is an organic dust that may be made from a number of different grains, including wheat, rye, millet, barley, oats, and corn. Flour contains allergens that are both naturally occurring and additives. Activities such as mixing, pouring, and weighing flour create airborne flour dust, which workers may inhale. Symptoms of exposure include cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and inflammation or swelling of the sinuses. Workers exposed to flour dust may develop an allergy or sensitization after repeated exposures. Once sensitization occurs, exposure to even a small amount of flour dust can trigger an asthma attack or an allergic reaction. The association between exposure to flour dust and the development of occupational asthma or other respiratory symptoms is well documented in the scientific literature. Health effects due to flour dust inhalation have resulted in occupational disease claims in B.C. Workers in bakery, flour manufacturing, and food processing settings may be at risk of developing adverse health effects as a result of exposure to flour dust. Health hazards\\nFlour contains naturally occurring chemicals that can induce allergy, respiratory sensitization, and, at increasing exposures, occupational asthma (baker's asthma). One of the most potent allergens in flour is alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase is an enzyme that occurs naturally, in small amounts, in wheat flour. It is also added as a dough improver to break up large starch molecules and speed up the activity of the yeast. Exposure limit\\nIn B.C., the eight-hour occupational exposure limit (OEL) for flour dust is 0.5 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/m3) of air. This would be the equivalent of a very small pinch of flour, smaller than a fingernail, being inhaled during a single work shift. Flour dust is also a sensitizer, and exposures must be kept as low as readily achievable (ALARA). ________________\\nExposure control\\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Regulation requires employers to select controls based on the following hierarchy:\\n1.

Wires with integral insulation but\\nnot otherwise protected are not considered as guarded. The visual identification flag line should be sufficient to keep workers and equipment a minimum safe distance away from the hazardous contact point. The requirement to prevent workers or equipment from entering this safe distance from\\nany area in which the worker is likely to pass or work, applies to general workers covered by the \\nRegulation\\n section 19.24 but not, for example, to qualified workers under the \\nRegulation\\n section 19.29. Safety watcher\\nIf the option of visual identification and electrical guarding is used, neither the limits of approach in \\nTable 19-1A\\n nor \\nTable 19-2\\n apply. The limit of approach is that neither the equipment nor unqualified persons may touch the guarding or\\nflag line (visual identification). Section 19.25(5) requires that a safety watcher or acceptable device must be designated to ensure that the guarding is not touched. Electrical guarding may provide some protection from electric shock in the\\nevent of brush contact but, because of site conditions, absolute assurance that no injury will occur cannot be given. The safety watcher must be given authority to stop the movement of the equipment when circumstances are warranted. An effective means of communication must be established between the safety watcher and the equipment operator\\nprior to commencement of work such that the stop signal is unambiguous. When equipment is operated or intended to be operated in proximity to energized conductors or equipment, the hazard due to contact is prevalent while the equipment is in motion. Therefore, the safety watcher should focus on thatmotion. The safety watcher may perform other duties while the equipment is not moving. It is essential that the safety watcher is somebody other than the person(s) controlling the movement of the equipment. G19.26 Assurance not practicable – Role of the safety watcher\\nIssued June 29, 2005; Editorial Revision to \\ninclude February 1, 2011 regulatory amendment; Editorial revision consequential to February 1, 2012 Regulatory Amendment\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 19.26 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\"\\nRegulation\\n\") \\nstates:\\n(1) If exposed high voltage electrical equipment and conductors cannot be isolated, rerouted or guarded, work must not be done within the minimum distance in Table 19-1A until the following precautions are taken:\\n(a) the area within which equipment or materials are to be moved must be barricaded and supervised to restrict entry only to those workers necessarily engaged in the work;\\n(b) a safety watcher must be designated;\\n(c) a positive means must be provided for the safety watcher to give a clear, understandable stop signal to workers in the area, and the watcher must give the stop signal by no other means. (2) While equipment is in motion in an area in proximity to energized electrical equipment or conductors, no person other than the equipment operator may touch any part of the equipment or the material being moved by it. (3) No person may move a load or any rigging line from its position of natural suspension if it is in proximity to an energized electrical conductor or equipment. Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to outline the role of the safety watcher under this section of the \\nRegulation\\n. Role of the safety watcher\\nIt is a rare occurrence when exposed high voltage electrical equipment and conductors cannot be isolated, rerouted, or guarded. For those exceptional cases, a safety watcher is required, and his/her duties should include monitoring the\\nfollowing criteria:\\nOnly necessary personnel shall be provided access to the restricted area in recognition of the hazards involved. When equipment is operated in proximity to energized conductors or equipment, the hazard due to contact is prevalent while the equipment is in motion. Therefore, the safety watcher needs to focus on that m', metadata={'chunk_size': 9674.0, 'file_name': 'Guidelines.pdf', 'semantic_index': 471.0, 'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ZJ_jH8P0DYpYaHz1nNsQMs4I_r1gpJz/view?usp=sharing'}), Document(page_content=\"Proper procedures will be followed for the donning, wearing, removing and storing of fall protection and related equipment.
