Risk identification and assessment\\nWorkers exposed to flour dust are at risk of health effects such as occupational asthma, respiratory sensitization, and allergy to flour dust. Flour is an organic dust that may be made from a number of different grains, including wheat, rye, millet, barley, oats, and corn. Flour contains allergens that are both naturally occurring and additives. Activities such as mixing, pouring, and weighing flour create airborne flour dust, which workers may inhale. Symptoms of exposure include cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and inflammation or swelling of the sinuses. Workers exposed to flour dust may develop an allergy or sensitization after repeated exposures. Once sensitization occurs, exposure to even a small amount of flour dust can trigger an asthma attack or an allergic reaction. The association between exposure to flour dust and the development of occupational asthma or other respiratory symptoms is well documented in the scientific literature. Health effects due to flour dust inhalation have resulted in occupational disease claims in B.C. Workers in bakery, flour manufacturing, and food processing settings may be at risk of developing adverse health effects as a result of exposure to flour dust. Health hazards\\nFlour contains naturally occurring chemicals that can induce allergy, respiratory sensitization, and, at increasing exposures, occupational asthma (baker's asthma). One of the most potent allergens in flour is alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase is an enzyme that occurs naturally, in small amounts, in wheat flour. It is also added as a dough improver to break up large starch molecules and speed up the activity of the yeast. Exposure limit\\nIn B.C., the eight-hour occupational exposure limit (OEL) for flour dust is 0.5 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/m3) of air. This would be the equivalent of a very small pinch of flour, smaller than a fingernail, being inhaled during a single work shift. Flour dust is also a sensitizer, and exposures must be kept as low as readily achievable (ALARA). ________________\\nExposure control\\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Regulation requires employers to select controls based on the following hierarchy:\\n1. Substitution (use flour types with fewer allergens; for example, fungal amylases)\\n2. Engineering controls (for example, mixer covers, local exhaust ventilation)\\n3.

Under this legislation, the MFLNRO grants rights to harvest and market timber to licensees through a variety of types of licenses or tenures. These licenses also place certain obligations on the licensees. In general the terms of the license\\ninclude conditions relating to harvesting practices, forest management, road building, reforestation, firefighting, and the like. Certain terms are dictated by forestry legislation; certain terms are functions of MFLNRO policy. Historically, timber harvesting and related operations, particularly on the coast, were typically carried out directly by the licensee. In recent years, however, forest operations have evolved into a complex multi-layered mix of contractors,\\nsubcontractors, and independent operators. In the interior, the evolution has been less dramatic, as in that regional operations have historically involved a wide variety of contractors, often provided for in the tenures provided to licensees. The MFLNRO determines an Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) for a particular broad region of the province, called a Timber Supply Area. This area may include any number of licenses, and provides specific authority to licensees to harvest\\ncertain areas included in their respective license area through specific cutting permits. Licensees tend to contract operations related to harvesting and forest management to subsidiary organizations or to third-party contractors. In particular, licensees will often contract with subsidiaries or third-party contractors to oversee\\nharvesting operations in specific areas (referred to as \"blocks\") within the cutting permit area. Such contractors (often referred to as \"stump to dump\" contractors) are often responsible for a wide range of operations with respect to a\\ngiven cutting permit. Those organizations, in turn, tend to contract out portions of the harvesting operations (such as falling, yarding, or timber transportation) within specific blocks to subcontractors (often referred to as \"phase\" contractors). Those\\nsubcontractors, in turn, may engage individuals such as fallers or equipment operators to perform specific tasks. These individuals might be employees under a contract of service or independent contractors, who also may engage other\\nworkers as employees or under contract. All of these different organizations and individuals have responsibilities for ensuring forestry operations are planned and conducted in a manner that ensures the health and safety of forest workers. \"Planning and conducting\" and the contracted out forestry workplace\\nSection 26.2(2) of the \\nRegulation\\n requires every person who has knowledge of and control over any particular activity in a forestry operation to ensure that the activity is both planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this\\nRegulation\\n and with safe work practices acceptable to WorkSafeBC. The health and safety at forestry workplaces is the responsibility of all workplace parties that have an influence on how work is conducted. Section 26.2(2) reinforces that idea by requiring each person in a forestry operation to plan and\\nconduct activities that they have knowledge of and control over. This obligation lies with all workplace parties. For example, the MFLNRO must ensure that access to Crown lands is provided in an adequately planned way so that\\nworkers of different tenure holders are not placed at risk. Licensees must plan overall operations in a manner that ensures that work can be carried out with a minimum of risk.

These \\nActs\\n do not remove WorkSafeBC\\'s general jurisdiction over activities on highways. Generally speaking, persons on highways must comply with all\\nthe relevant provisions of the applicable acts and regulations. If, for example, there are \\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n regulations and \\nWorkers Compensation Act\\n regulations governing their activities, they must follow both. 4\\n. If there is an inconsistency between two \\nActs\\n or their regulations, the one that is most specific to the particular circumstance will govern. This means that generally speaking the special provincial acts relating to highways listed in\\nitem 3 above would override any contrary provision in WorkSafeBC\\'s regulations. This is reflected in the note to section 16.2 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n, which states \"Mobile equipment required to meet the requirements of the\\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n or the \\nIndustrial Transportation Act\\n is subject to this Regulation for matters not specifically governed by those Acts and the regulations under them.\"\\n5\\n. It is not the role of officers of WorkSafeBC to enforce other provincial acts and regulations relating to activities on public roads.

Violations of other acts and regulations would typically be drawn to the attention of the other appropriate jurisdictional authority. Policy 6.04 was retired effective October 1, 2001.

The application of a specific provision in Part 26 will depend on the wording of the particular section. Certain provisions in Part 26 will state that they relate only to \\n\"forestry operations,\" while others will not be limited by the use of this\\nterm. For example, \\nsection 26.2\\n requires all aspects of a forestry operation to be \"planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this \\nRegulation\\n.\" This section would only apply to owners of workplaces that fall within the definition of a\\nforestry operation by being workplaces \\n\"where work is done in relation to silviculture and harvesting trees… \"\\nIn contrast, \\nsection 26.21\\n states that \\n\"a worker must not fall trees or be permitted to fall trees…\" unless the worker is qualified and only performs work within the worker\\'s documented capabilities, and does not restrict itself to workers in\\na \"forestry operation.\" As this section does not refer specifically to forestry operations, it can be applied more broadly to both forestry operations and similar activities.

There are several other provincial statutes regulating activities on public roads. These include the \\nCommercial Transport Act\\n, the \\nForest Practice Code of British Columbia Act\\n, the \\nHighway Act\\n, the \\nIndustrial\\nTransportation Act\\n, the \\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n, and the \\nMotor Carrier Act\\n. These \\nActs\\n do not remove WorkSafeBC\\'s general jurisdiction over activities on highways. Generally speaking, persons on highways must comply with all\\nthe relevant provisions of the applicable acts and regulations. If, for example, there are \\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n regulations and \\nWorkers Compensation Act\\n regulations governing their activities, they must follow both. 4\\n. If there is an inconsistency between two \\nActs\\n or their regulations, the one that is most specific to the particular circumstance will govern. This means that generally speaking the special provincial acts relating to highways listed in\\nitem 3 above would override any contrary provision in WorkSafeBC\\'s regulations. This is reflected in the note to section 16.2 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n, which states \"Mobile equipment required to meet the requirements of the\\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n or the \\nIndustrial Transportation Act\\n is subject to this Regulation for matters not specifically governed by those Acts and the regulations under them.\"\\n5\\n. It is not the role of officers of WorkSafeBC to enforce other provincial acts and regulations relating to activities on public roads. Inspections and investigations by officers of WorkSafeBC should generally be confined to matters\\ncovered by the \\nWorkers Compensation Act\\n and regulations. Violations of other acts and regulations would typically be drawn to the attention of the other appropriate jurisdictional authority. Policy 6.04 was retired effective October 1, 2001. Prevention officers of WorkSafeBC should inspect and investigate occurrences on highways on the basis of the same criteria that they apply with respect to other workplaces.

The fulcrum, located in the centreline of the front\\naxle of the truck, is the pivot point of the seesaw. See Figure 1. Figure 1: Counterbalance lift truck (for illustration purposes only) \\nWhen a lift truck\\'s load exceeds its capacity rating (weight and/or load centre), unstable conditions are introduced that may cause the truck to tip over. The capacity rating of a lift truck is identified on its data plate (affixed to the truck by the manufacturer) and displays the maximum load (expressed in pounds or kilograms) it can safely raise, lower, and move. The capacity rating consists\\nof two components: \\nweight and load centre. The weight is the weight of the load. The load centre is the horizontal distance between the face of the forks and the centre of gravity (CG) of the load (expressed in inches or millimetres), and\\nthe vertical distance of the travelling surface to the load centre. The CG is the point on an object where its weight is evenly dispersed and all its parts are in balance. A front end attachment (e.g., fork extension, paper roll clamp) on a lift truck has its own rated capacity causing the truck\\'s load capacity rating to change. As a load centre distance increases the \"load moment\" increases. The load moment, or moment, is the product of the load\\'s weight multiplied by the distance of the CG of the load to the fulcrum (pivot point). It is the moment that\\ndetermines how much overturning force is being applied to the lift truck. For example, if a forklift\\'s stated capacity rating is 3,000 pounds at a 24 inch load centre, the load moment cannot safely exceed 72,000 inch-pounds (24 inches x\\n3,000 lb = 72,000 inch-pounds). If the load centre distance for the actual load is greater than 24 inches, the only way to keep the load moment from exceeding 72,000 inch-pounds, which could result in the forklift tipping over laterally, is\\nto reduce the load. Stability triangle\\nA lift truck\\'s steer axle is attached to the truck by a pivot pin in its rear axle\\'s centre. When this point is connected to the centre of the two front wheels with imaginary lines it forms a triangle called the stability triangle. A lift truck and load\\neach has its own CG. When a load is placed on a lift truck, the CG of the truck shifts, and a combined centre of gravity (CCG) is created. If the CCG is located outside the stability triangle, unstable conditions are introduced causing the\\ntruck to tip over either laterally on its side or tip longitudinally forward. Tip direction is determined by where the CCG is outside the stability triangle. See Figure 2.Figure 2: Stability triangle \\nMeasures to ensure stability\\nThe following measures are not an exhaustive list and do not replace lift truck safety standards:\\nEnsure the lift truck is in good operating condition (e.g., the tires are inflated in accordance with the truck\\'s manufacturer standards, brakes are in optimal working condition). Ensure the load is positioned against the mast, centred across the forks, and its weight evenly distributed. Avoid tilting forks forward unless picking up or setting down a load. Exercise caution when handling loads that are close to the truck\\'s stated capacity rating. When elevating a load, reduce the load capacity, and carry it at its lowest possible position. Maintain a clear path of travel and be aware of blind spots. Travel at a slow speed, and exercise extra caution when turning. Keep loads elevated only for as long as required to clear the obstruction. The higher the load is elevated, the less stable the lift truck becomes. Be aware of the impact of dynamic forces (e.g., braking suddenly, accelerating rapidly, turning sharply, operating on uneven surfaces) as the load moment created by these motions may cause the lift truck to tip over.

Prevention officers may attend a workplace in response to a complaint of workplace bullying and harassment. Given the sensitivity surrounding allegations of workplace bullying and harassment, the prevention officer may contact\\nthe employer before attending the workplace. Advance notice will also ensure the appropriate employer and worker representatives are present.5\\n. Where the workplace is \\noccupied as a private residence, advance notice may be required as set out in \\nsection 76(1)(b) of the \\nAct\\n. An employer may request that a prevention officer consult with them and provide education on matters relating to workplace health and safety. If, during the course of an employer-initiated inspection, violations of the \\nAct\\n or \\nRegulation\\nare observed, the prevention officer may issue orders or enter into a compliance agreement with the employer. G-P2-75-2 Commencement of an inspection\\nIssued October 27, 2004; Editorial Revision November 1, 2017; Editorial Revision April 6, 2020\\nWhen starting an inspection, a Board prevention officer will inform the employer and worker representative, if any, as to the nature of the inspection; that is safety or hygiene, occupational environment, medical, or a combination of any\\ntwo or more. Although an inspection is made for a specific purpose, for example safety, other observed violations will be addressed. There are special procedures for initiating certain types of inspections, for example, federal WHMIS inspections conducted on behalf of Employment and Social Development Canada (EDSC). The officers doing those inspections will be\\ntrained in those procedures. Where a prevention officer attends at a place of work for a purpose other than an inspection, the employer and the appropriate workers\\' representative should be notified that the officer has not come for an inspection, although immediate\\nhazards observed by the prevention officer will be addressed. A prevention officer will only cross a picket line, legally established or otherwise, to carry out Board duties when so directed by a Manager or Director and when the union organizing the line agrees. If the union does not agree, the\\nprevention officer will report the circumstances to the Manager or Director for instructions.

As the owner with the greatest control over the workplace, it is\\nappropriate that the licensee act as the \"default\" prime contractor. Even though there may be a \"stump to dump\" contractor who may be a directing contractor over a broad portion of forestry operations, that contractor will not be the\\nprime contractor unless there is a specific designation in a written agreement that the contractor will act as prime contractor for the purposes of coordinating occupational health and safety matters. Also, in accordance with Policy Item P2-24-1, there can be only one \"prime contractor\" at a workplace at any point in time. If an owner enters into more than one agreement purporting to create a \"prime contractor \" for the same period\\nof time, the owner will be considered to be the prime contractor. For information on which owner may designate the prime contractor, please refer to OHS Guideline \\nG26.1-2\\n. \"Qualified\"\\nSection 26.1.1 states that the owner must ensure the prime contractor at a multiple-employer forestry workplace is qualified. \"Qualified\" is defined in section 1.1 of the \\nRegulation\\n as \"being knowledgeable of the work, the hazards\\ninvolved and the means to control the hazards, by reason of education, training, experience or a combination thereof.\" \\nMultiple-employer forestry workplaces will involve a complex mix of work activities and hazards. Owners are\\ntherefore expected to ensure that prime contractors they designate have a significant level of experience and training specific to the types of operations that they will be coordinating. Being \"qualified\" also involves possessing knowledge of\\nhow to control hazards; a qualified prime contractor must not only have knowledge of work processes, but knowledge of hazard recognition and managing health and safety risks. Note that under section 24 of the \\nAct\\n, the owner must agree in writing with the prime contractor that the prime contractor will act in that capacity. The prime contractor must be aware that it has agreed in writing to act in that capacity,\\nand the language of the agreement must be adequately clear that the parties intended that the prime contractor act in that capacity. Failure to have an adequate written agreement will result in the owner being required to fulfill the prime\\ncontractor obligations. What are the obligations? Under section 24(1) of the \\nAct\\n, the prime contractor is responsible for coordinating activities relating to health and safety at the workplace. Coordination will extend to logistical matters relating to the work carried out by the employers at\\nthe workplace. The prime contractor of a forestry workplace must, as a function of this coordination role, perform a risk assessment to determine appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce hazards faced by workers in the area in\\nquestion.The prime contractor is also responsible for establishing a system or process to ensure health and safety compliance. This may involve establishing a safety program as described in the OHS provisions, Division 4 of the \\nAct\\n and\\nsection 3.3\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n with respect to the entire workplace, as well as making regular inspections of the workplace as contemplated by section \\n3.5\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n. It may also involve the creation of a joint health and safety\\ncommittee for the entire workplace. At a minimum, prime contractors should ensure that things like the initial safety meeting under section \\n26.5\\n and the orientation of young or new workers under section \\n3.23\\n take place. In addition, a\\nnecessary feature of any system or process is the ability to monitor and maintain that system.

Supervisor obligations\\nWorkers using resource roads must also be adequately supervised. Section 23\\n of the \\nAct\\n requires supervisors to ensure the health and safety of workers under their supervision and make those workers aware of foreseeable\\nhazards. This obligation would include a number of the activities described above, such as providing adequate information on road conditions and hazards and monitoring worker activity and behaviour in using the roads. 3\\n.

Primarily, workers must take reasonable care under \\nsection 22\\n of the \\nAct\\n to ensure their own safety and carry out their work in accordance with safe work procedures. \\\"Safe\\nwork procedures\\\" would include the instruction provided by the employer and/or supervisor for safe use of the road, as well as any traffic control procedures established for the particular road. In addition to the general obligation in the \\nAct\\n, there are specific requirements in the \\nRegulation\\n relating to operating vehicles, log transporters, and mobile equipment that will apply. Primarily, section 26.71.1 states that the\\noperator of a log transporter must follow safe operating procedures, including the following:\\nNot overtaking another moving industrial vehicle, except on a signal from the other vehicle operator\\nUsing extreme caution when approaching vehicles coming from the opposite direction\\nKeeping a safe distance when following crew transportation vehicles; having due regard for road and grade conditions and visibility\\nDriving at a speed appropriate to the log transporter's capabilities, the road design and condition, the traffic, the visibility, and the weather conditions\\nNot operating the log transporter while impaired by fatigue, or any other cause, substance, or matter that could prevent the operator from operating the log transporter safely\\nIn addition to section 26.71.1, the \\nRegulation\\n contains the following obligations that workers must comply with:\\nSection 17.1.1 states that vehicles used to transport workers must be operated in a safe manner. Section 26.83.1\\n states that vehicles must use a traffic control system when the road is too narrow to permit 2 vehicles to pass.\\n\\nThe situation may arise where there appears to be compliance with the \\nRegulation\\n, or with a variance granted by WorkSafeBC, but a prevention officer feels the engineering work is inadequate and could endanger a worker. In such\\ncases, the prevention officer will not reject the engineering certification, approval, or design without authorization from the prevention officer's manager, and upon the recommendation of an engineer from the Engineering section of\\nWorkSafeBC. The Engineering section should be contacted for assistance in reviewing unclear, vague, and generally unprofessional engineering documents left on job sites for the purpose of compliance with the \\nRegulation\\n. The Engineering section may\\ninitiate a formal complaint to Engineers & Geoscientists British Columbia (EGBC). Each potential complaint will be assessed on an individual basis. Before a complaint is made, a member of the Engineering section will review the letter\\nand attachments for each complaint. The reviewer will be an engineer who has had no direct dealings with the person named in the complaint on the matter at issue. The reviewer will comment on the content, completeness, and apparent\\nreasonableness of the complaint. As an engineer is generally working in and contributing to the production of an industry, a prevention officer may write orders on the engineer, and the engineer's firm, if the documents provided are inadequate and/or do not meet the\\nrequirements of the \\nRegulation\\n.

G1.1(1) Resource Roads\\nIssued November 29, 2012; Editorial Revision April 6, 2020; Editorial Revision consequential to September 1, 2021 Regulatory Amendment\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 1.1(1) of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\\\"\\nRegulation\\n\\\") states, in part:\\n\\\"\\nresource road\\n\\\" means a road or portion of a road on Crown land, and includes a bridge, culvert, ford or other structure or work associated with the road, but does not include a highway within the meaning of the\\nTransportation Act\\n,\\nSections 1.1(2) – (4) of the \\nRegulation\\n state:\\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), in this Regulation, \\n\\\"workplace\\\"\\n does not include a resource road. (3) A portion of a resource road is a workplace during any period within which the portion is being built, maintained, repaired, rehabilitated, stabilized, upgraded, removed or deactivated. (4) Although a resource road does not constitute a workplace for the purposes of this Regulation, other than in one of the limited circumstances referred to in subsection (3), a reference to a workplace in this Regulation\\ncontinues to include a thing or place that constitutes a workplace even though that thing, or an activity or the result of an activity initiated or carried out at that place, is in whole or in part on a resource road. Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to set out the circumstances under which a resource road is a workplace for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n. Resource roads - What are they? Resource roads are defined for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n as follows:\\na road or portion of a road on Crown land, and includes a bridge, culvert, ford or other structure or work associated with the road, but does not include a highway within the meaning of the \\nTransportation Act\\n;\\nMany industrial activities, in particular the development, management, and transportation of natural resources, are accessed through the use of resource roads. Resource roads are non-highway roads on Crown land constructed and\\nmaintained under a variety of legislation. These roads include forest service roads, forest roads, petroleum development roads, mineral exploration roads, and some industrial roads. Private roads are not considered resource roads. Resource road not a workplace \\nSection 1.1(2) states that, except in specific circumstances, a resource road is not a \\\"workplace\\\" for the purposes of the \\nRe\\n\\n(2) Without limiting subsection (1), an employer must\\n(a) remedy any workplace conditions that are hazardous to the health or safety of the employer's workers... (e) provide to the employer's workers the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary to ensure the health and safety of those workers in carrying out their work... Section 22 of the \\nAct\\n states in part:\\nGeneral duties of workers(1) Every worker must\\n(a) take reasonable care to protect the worker's health and safety and the health and safety of other persons who may be affected by the worker's acts or omissions at work.... Section 23 of the \\nAct\\n states in part:\\nGeneral duties of supervisors\\n(1) Every supervisor must\\n(a) ensure the health and safety of all workers under the direct supervision of the supervisor... Section 3.5 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nGeneral requirement\\nEvery employer must ensure that regular inspections are made of all workplaces, including buildings, structures, grounds, excavations, tools, equipment, machinery and work methods and practices, at intervals that will\\nprevent the development of unsafe working conditions. Section 3.7 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nSpecial inspections\\nA special inspection must be made when required by malfunction or accident. Section 3.9 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nRemedy without delay\\nUnsafe or harmful conditions found in the course of an inspection must be remedied without delay. Section 3.10 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nReporting unsafe conditions\\nWhenever a person observes what appears to be an unsafe or harmful condition or act the person must report it as soon as possible to a supervisor or to the employer, and the person receiving the report must investigate the\\nreported unsafe condition or act and must ensure that any necessary corrective action is taken without delay. Section 5.81 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nCombustible dust\\nIf combustible dust collects in a building or structure or on machinery or equipment, it must be safely removed before accumulation of the dust could cause a fire or explosion. Prevention Policy Item (\\\"Policy\\\") P2-21-3\\n states in part:\\nReasonable Steps to Address the Hazard\\nWorkSafeBC considers that reasonable steps by an employer to address the hazards of combustible wood dust include the following:\\n(a) conducting a risk assessment to identify combustible wood dust hazards at the workplace;\\n(b) developing and implementing a combustible wood dust management program to effectively address combustible wood dust hazards;\\n(c) educating and training workers and supervisors about the hazards and measures in the combustible wood dust management program to control the hazards;\\n(d) ensuring that the combustible wood dust management program is fully implemented;\\n(e) undergoing a wood dust mitigation and control audit as soon as reasonably possible after implementing the program, then\\n(i) promptly implementing recommendations from the audit, and\\n(ii) conducting a new audit if there is any material change to work processes or equipment;\\n(f) reviewing the combustible wood dust management program\\n(i) annually, and\\n(ii) simultaneously with any material changes to work processes or equipment to ensure that these changes are addressed; and\\n(g) complying with the employer's combustible wood dust management program. Policy P2-22-2\\n states:\\nA worker's obligation to take reasonable care to protect the health and safety of themselves or others includes:\\n(a) reporting unsafe conditions or actions relating to combustible wood dust in the workplace to a supervisor, or to the employer, as soon as possible; and\\n(b) complying with the employer's combustible wood dust management program. Policy P2-23-3\\n states:\\nIn addition to a supervisor's duties as a worker or employer, a supervisor's obligation to ensure the health and safety of workers includes:\\n(a) investigating any reports received by the supervisor or inspection results identifying an unsafe condition or act relating to combustible wood dust and e\\n\\nThe management of the forests and lands in\\nwhich forestry operations take place is governed by a variety of legislation, including the \\nForest Act\\n and the \\nForest and Range Practices Act\\n and regulations associated with these Acts. Under this legislation, the MFLNRO grants rights to harvest and market timber to licensees through a variety of types of licenses or tenures. These licenses also place certain obligations on the licensees. In general the terms of the license\\ninclude conditions relating to harvesting practices, forest management, road building, reforestation, firefighting, and the like. Certain terms are dictated by forestry legislation; certain terms are functions of MFLNRO policy. Historically, timber harvesting and related operations, particularly on the coast, were typically carried out directly by the licensee. In recent years, however, forest operations have evolved into a complex multi-layered mix of contractors,\\nsubcontractors, and independent operators. In the interior, the evolution has been less dramatic, as in that regional operations have historically involved a wide variety of contractors, often provided for in the tenures provided to licensees. The MFLNRO determines an Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) for a particular broad region of the province, called a Timber Supply Area. This area may include any number of licenses, and provides specific authority to licensees to harvest\\ncertain areas included in their respective license area through specific cutting permits. Licensees tend to contract operations related to harvesting and forest management to subsidiary organizations or to third-party contractors. In particular, licensees will often contract with subsidiaries or third-party contractors to oversee\\nharvesting operations in specific areas (referred to as \\\"blocks\\\") within the cutting permit area. Such contractors (often referred to as \\\"stump to dump\\\" contractors) are often responsible for a wide range of operations with respect to a\\ngiven cutting permit. Those organizations, in turn, tend to contract out portions of the harvesting operations (such as falling, yarding, or timber transportation) within specific blocks to subcontractors (often referred to as \\\"phase\\\" contractors). Those\\nsubcontractors, in turn, may engage individuals such as fallers or equipment operators to perform specific tasks. These individuals might be employees under a contract of service or independent contractors, who also may engage other\\nworkers as employees or under contract. All of these different organizations and individuals have responsibilities for ensuring forestry operations are planned and conducted in a manner that ensures the health and safety of forest workers. \\\"Planning and conducting\\\" and the contracted out forestry workplace\\nSection 26.2(2) of the \\nRegulation\\n requires every person who has knowledge of and control over any particular activity in a forestry operation to ensure that the activity is both planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this\\nRegulation\\n and with safe work practices acceptable to WorkSafeBC. The health and safety at forestry workplaces is the responsibility of all workplace parties that have an influence on how work is conducted. Section 26.2(2) reinforces that idea by requiring each person in a forestry operation to plan and\\nconduct activities that they have knowledge of and control over. This obligation lies with all workplace parties. For example, the MFLNRO must ensure that access to Crown lands is provided in an adequately planned way so that\\nworkers of different tenure holders are not placed at risk. Licensees must plan overall operations in a manner that ensures that work can be carried out with a minimum of risk. Workers, for their part, must carry out their work in a manner\\nthat protects their own safety and the safety of other workers. With respect to work that is to be provided under contract, \\\"plan and conduct\\\" should include the following obligations:\\nEvaluating the risks the\"\n","}\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m[llm/start]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[1:chain:RetrievalQA > 3:chain:StuffDocumentsChain > 4:chain:LLMChain > 5:llm:ChatOpenAI] Entering LLM run with input:\n","\u001b[0m{\n","  \"prompts\": [\n","    \"System: Use the following pieces of context to answer the user's question. \\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n----------------\\n2\\n.

Being \\\"qualified\\\" also involves possessing knowledge of\\nhow to control hazards; a qualified prime contractor must not only have knowledge of work processes, but knowledge of hazard recognition and managing health and safety risks. Note that under section 24 of the \\nAct\\n, the owner must agree in writing with the prime contractor that the prime contractor will act in that capacity. The prime contractor must be aware that it has agreed in writing to act in that capacity,\\nand the language of the agreement must be adequately clear that the parties intended that the prime contractor act in that capacity. Failure to have an adequate written agreement will result in the owner being required to fulfill the prime\\ncontractor obligations. What are the obligations? Under section 24(1) of the \\nAct\\n, the prime contractor is responsible for coordinating activities relating to health and safety at the workplace. Coordination will extend to logistical matters relating to the work carried out by the employers at\\nthe workplace. The prime contractor of a forestry workplace must, as a function of this coordination role, perform a risk assessment to determine appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce hazards faced by workers in the area in\\nquestion.The prime contractor is also responsible for establishing a system or process to ensure health and safety compliance. This may involve establishing a safety program as described in the OHS provisions, Division 4 of the \\nAct\\n and\\nsection 3.3\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n with respect to the entire workplace, as well as making regular inspections of the workplace as contemplated by section \\n3.5\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n. It may also involve the creation of a joint health and safety\\ncommittee for the entire workplace. At a minimum, prime contractors should ensure that things like the initial safety meeting under section \\n26.5\\n and the orientation of young or new workers under section \\n3.23\\n take place. In addition, a\\nnecessary feature of any system or process is the ability to monitor and maintain that system. A prime contractor must take steps to ensure the employers it is coordinating are complying with and participating in its system. In addition to the duties on prime contractors contained in the \\nAct\\n, section \\n2\\n\\n2\\n. Supervisor obligations\\nWorkers using resource roads must also be adequately supervised. Section 23\\n of the \\nAct\\n requires supervisors to ensure the health and safety of workers under their supervision and make those workers aware of foreseeable\\nhazards. This obligation would include a number of the activities described above, such as providing adequate information on road conditions and hazards and monitoring worker activity and behaviour in using the roads. 3\\n. Worker obligations\\nWorkers also have obligations to use roads safely. Primarily, workers must take reasonable care under \\nsection 22\\n of the \\nAct\\n to ensure their own safety and carry out their work in accordance with safe work procedures. \\\"Safe\\nwork procedures\\\" would include the instruction provided by the employer and/or supervisor for safe use of the road, as well as any traffic control procedures established for the particular road. In addition to the general obligation in the \\nAct\\n, there are specific requirements in the \\nRegulation\\n relating to operating vehicles, log transporters, and mobile equipment that will apply. Primarily, section 26.71.1 states that the\\noperator of a log transporter must follow safe operating procedures, including the following:\\nNot overtaking another moving industrial vehicle, except on a signal from the other vehicle operator\\nUsing extreme caution when approaching vehicles coming from the opposite direction\\nKeeping a safe distance when following crew transportation vehicles; having due regard for road and grade conditions and visibility\\nDriving at a speed appropriate to the log transporter's capabilities, the road design and condition, the traffic, the visibility, and the weather conditions\\nNot operating the log transporter while impaired by fatigue, or any other cause, substance, or matter that could prevent the operator from operating the log transporter safely\\nIn addition to section 26.71.1, the \\nRegulation\\n contains the following obligations that workers must comply with:\\nSection 17.1.1 states that vehicles used to transport workers must be operated in a safe manner.

G26.1-1 \\nForestry operations and similar activities\\nIssued May 1, 2008\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 26.1 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\\\"\\nRegulation\\n\\\") states:\\n\\\"forestry operation\\\"\\n means a workplace where work is done in relation to silviculture or harvesting trees, including constructing the means of access and transporting the harvested trees to a facility where they are\\nprocessed or from which they are exported. Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to describe the scope and application of the requirements of Part 26 of the \\nRegulation\\n. \\\"Forestry Operations and Similar Activities\\\" and the application of Part 26The title of Part 26 of the \\nRegulation\\n is \\\"Forestry Operations and Similar Activities.\\\" This title reflects the intent to capture in the scope of Part 26 not only those workplaces that are involved in forestry operations as defined in\\nsection 26.1, but operations that have similar characteristics, hazards, and work processes. The application of a specific provision in Part 26 will depend on the wording of the particular section. Certain provisions in Part 26 will state that they relate only to \\n\\\"forestry operations,\\\" while others will not be limited by the use of this\\nterm. For example, \\nsection 26.2\\n requires all aspects of a forestry operation to be \\\"planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this \\nRegulation\\n.\\\" This section would only apply to owners of workplaces that fall within the definition of a\\nforestry operation by being workplaces \\n\\\"where work is done in relation to silviculture and harvesting trees… \\\"\\nIn contrast, \\nsection 26.21\\n states that \\n\\\"a worker must not fall trees or be permitted to fall trees…\\\" unless the worker is qualified and only performs work within the worker's documented capabilities, and does not restrict itself to workers in\\na \\\"forestry operation.\\\" As this section does not refer specifically to forestry operations, it can be applied more broadly to both forestry operations and similar activities. What is work relating to \\\"harvesting trees\\\"? The definition of \\n\\\"forestry operation\\\" includes \\\"work done in relation to … harvesting trees.\\\" WorkSafeBC considers work relating to \\n\\\"harvesting trees\\\" to be any ope\\n\\nWorker transport vehicles:\\n These are typically owned and operated by FLCs. As such FLCs are responsible for all aspects of safety of the vehicle including condition, maintenance, operation, and use. Requirements apply under\\nprovisions such as \\nPart 17 (Worker transportation)\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n, and those under the \\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n. Growers who contract with FLCs are expected to exercise an oversight function when the vehicle arrives on site. Should they observe any faulty condition of the vehicle or unsafe operation they should draw it to the attention of the FLC\\nto ensure it is corrected. In addition, as owners, the growers have a responsibility to make sure that the site is safe, including any roadway to be used by the worker transport vehicle operated by the FLC. 2. Personal protective equipment (PPE):\\n Part 8 (Personal Protective Clothing and Equipment) of the \\nRegulation\\n provides the applicable requirements. Section 8.2 outlines the obligations of workers and employers. Generally,\\nworkers are expected to provide clothing for protection against the natural elements such as weather, and general purpose work gloves, footwear, and safety headgear if needed. However, the \\nRegulation\\n also recognizes that an\\nemployer may provide any or all of these items. An employer must provide any other PPE required for the protection of workers. This might include protective gloves, clothing, or respirators if workers may be exposed to pesticides or other harmful materials, and hearing protection if\\nworkers will be working near noisy equipment. Typically, the grower controls the circumstances where workers may be at risk on the worksite and would have the expertise on appropriate PPE. In such cases, the grower would have a\\nprimary responsibility for provision of such equipment, but the FLC shares in that responsibility. 3. First aid:\\n Under the requirements for first aid in Part 3 (Rights and Responsibilities) of the \\nRegulation\\n, the FLC is responsible for the provision of first aid for farm workers in their employ. First aid equipment must be provided on\\nworker transport vehicles as required by \\nsection 17.10\\n (Vehicle design), as well as appropriate fire extinguishers. Typically the equipment required will be a Level 1 first aid kit, except where a very small number of workers are\\ntransported, in which case a basic kit may be sufficient. Once workers have been transported to a worksite, the hazard assessment is likely to change, as many agricultural worksites are at least moderate risk. First aid for the FLC's workers would have to be adjusted accordingly. In addition,\\nif the grower employs workers other than those provided by the FLC, then the first aid for the site needs to take account of the total number of workers on site. As previously mentioned, the grower typically has employer responsibilities on site for workers provided by the farm labour contractor. If in a particular situation the grower is a prime contractor (refer to section 24 of the \\nAct\\n), thensection 3.20 of the \\nRegulation\\n requires the grower to do everything that is reasonably practicable to establish and maintain the necessary first aid capability on the site. Unless there is an unusual circumstance, such as a short term situation\\nin which the FLC provides more workers than was originally requested, it will be considered practicable for the grower to provide first aid that covers all workers on site. 4. Protection from hazardous materials:\\n Typically workers employed by FLCs carry out activities such as pruning, thinning, and harvesting. In most cases, if there are hazardous materials present in a workplace, then they are likely to\\nbe under the control of the grower. Under their responsibilities as both owners and employers, growers are required to maintain a safe site, and ensure that FLCs are given the information needed to ensure the safety of the FLC's workers. Information requirements on hazardous materials are covered primarily in \\nPart 5 (Chemical Age\"\n","}\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m[llm/start]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[1:chain:RetrievalQA > 3:chain:StuffDocumentsChain > 4:chain:LLMChain > 5:llm:ChatOpenAI] Entering LLM run with input:\n","\u001b[0m{\n","  \"prompts\": [\n","    \"System: Use the following pieces of context to answer the user's question. \\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n----------------\\nSection 13 of the \\nAct\\n provides that the prime contractor will be the owner, unless there is a specific agreement designating another person as the prime contractor.

G26.1-1 \\nForestry operations and similar activities\\nIssued May 1, 2008\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 26.1 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\\\"\\nRegulation\\n\\\") states:\\n\\\"forestry operation\\\"\\n means a workplace where work is done in relation to silviculture or harvesting trees, including constructing the means of access and transporting the harvested trees to a facility where they are\\nprocessed or from which they are exported. Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to describe the scope and application of the requirements of Part 26 of the \\nRegulation\\n. \\\"Forestry Operations and Similar Activities\\\" and the application of Part 26The title of Part 26 of the \\nRegulation\\n is \\\"Forestry Operations and Similar Activities.\\\" This title reflects the intent to capture in the scope of Part 26 not only those workplaces that are involved in forestry operations as defined in\\nsection 26.1, but operations that have similar characteristics, hazards, and work processes. The application of a specific provision in Part 26 will depend on the wording of the particular section. Certain provisions in Part 26 will state that they relate only to \\n\\\"forestry operations,\\\" while others will not be limited by the use of this\\nterm. For example, \\nsection 26.2\\n requires all aspects of a forestry operation to be \\\"planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this \\nRegulation\\n.\\\" This section would only apply to owners of workplaces that fall within the definition of a\\nforestry operation by being workplaces \\n\\\"where work is done in relation to silviculture and harvesting trees… \\\"\\nIn contrast, \\nsection 26.21\\n states that \\n\\\"a worker must not fall trees or be permitted to fall trees…\\\" unless the worker is qualified and only performs work within the worker's documented capabilities, and does not restrict itself to workers in\\na \\\"forestry operation.\\\" As this section does not refer specifically to forestry operations, it can be applied more broadly to both forestry operations and similar activities. What is work relating to \\\"harvesting trees\\\"? The definition of \\n\\\"forestry operation\\\" includes \\\"work done in relation to … harvesting trees.\\\" WorkSafeBC considers work relating to \\n\\\"harvesting trees\\\" to be any ope\\n\\nWorker transport vehicles:\\n These are typically owned and operated by FLCs. As such FLCs are responsible for all aspects of safety of the vehicle including condition, maintenance, operation, and use. Requirements apply under\\nprovisions such as \\nPart 17 (Worker transportation)\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n, and those under the \\nMotor Vehicle Act\\n. Growers who contract with FLCs are expected to exercise an oversight function when the vehicle arrives on site. Should they observe any faulty condition of the vehicle or unsafe operation they should draw it to the attention of the FLC\\nto ensure it is corrected. In addition, as owners, the growers have a responsibility to make sure that the site is safe, including any roadway to be used by the worker transport vehicle operated by the FLC. 2. Personal protective equipment (PPE):\\n Part 8 (Personal Protective Clothing and Equipment) of the \\nRegulation\\n provides the applicable requirements. Section 8.2 outlines the obligations of workers and employers. Generally,\\nworkers are expected to provide clothing for protection against the natural elements such as weather, and general purpose work gloves, footwear, and safety headgear if needed. However, the \\nRegulation\\n also recognizes that an\\nemployer may provide any or all of these items. An employer must provide any other PPE required for the protection of workers. This might include protective gloves, clothing, or respirators if workers may be exposed to pesticides or other harmful materials, and hearing protection if\\nworkers will be working near noisy equipment. Typically, the grower controls the circumstances where workers may be at risk on the worksite and would have the expertise on appropriate PPE. In such cases, the grower would have a\\nprimary responsibility for provision of such equipment, but the FLC shares in that responsibility. 3. First aid:\\n Under the requirements for first aid in Part 3 (Rights and Responsibilities) of the \\nRegulation\\n, the FLC is responsible for the provision of first aid for farm workers in their employ. First aid equipment must be provided on\\nworker transport vehicles as required by \\nsection 17.10\\n (Vehicle design), as well as appropriate fire extinguishers. Typically the equipment required will be a Level 1 first aid kit, except where a very small number of workers are\\ntransported, in which case a basic kit may be sufficient. Once workers have been transported to a worksite, the hazard assessment is likely to change, as many agricultural worksites are at least moderate risk. First aid for the FLC's workers would have to be adjusted accordingly. In addition,\\nif the grower employs workers other than those provided by the FLC, then the first aid for the site needs to take account of the total number of workers on site. As previously mentioned, the grower typically has employer responsibilities on site for workers provided by the farm labour contractor. If in a particular situation the grower is a prime contractor (refer to section 24 of the \\nAct\\n), thensection 3.20 of the \\nRegulation\\n requires the grower to do everything that is reasonably practicable to establish and maintain the necessary first aid capability on the site. Unless there is an unusual circumstance, such as a short term situation\\nin which the FLC provides more workers than was originally requested, it will be considered practicable for the grower to provide first aid that covers all workers on site. 4. Protection from hazardous materials:\\n Typically workers employed by FLCs carry out activities such as pruning, thinning, and harvesting. In most cases, if there are hazardous materials present in a workplace, then they are likely to\\nbe under the control of the grower. Under their responsibilities as both owners and employers, growers are required to maintain a safe site, and ensure that FLCs are given the information needed to ensure the safety of the FLC's workers. Information requirements on hazardous materials are covered primarily in \\nPart 5 (Chemical Age\\nHuman: What legislation governs the management of forests and lands where forestry operations occur, and what are some of the obligations placed on licensees by these laws?\"\n","  ]\n","}\n","\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m[llm/end]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[1:chain:RetrievalQA > 3:chain:StuffDocumentsChain > 4:chain:LLMChain > 5:llm:ChatOpenAI] [24.95s] Exiting LLM run with output:\n","\u001b[0m{\n","  \"generations\": [\n","    [\n","      {\n","        \"text\": \"The management of forests and lands where forestry operations occur is governed by a variety of legislation, which may include specific forestry acts, occupational health and safety (OHS) regulations, and environmental protection laws, depending on the jurisdiction.

Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to clarify riding restrictions as stated in section 17.4 of the \\nRegulation\\n. Standing\\nGenerally, standing will be allowed in large-capacity crew transportation vehicles not required by motor vehicle legislation to have seat belts. This applies, for example, to a city or transit type of bus, manufactured and equipped for this\\ntype of use. Even in such vehicles, standing should only be permitted in a controlled environment where speed, travel distance and transit time are low; for example, at a pulp mill construction site or on urban streets. Standing should not\\nbe permitted where highway speeds, long distances, or lengthy travel time are factors; for example, transport to a distant logging site on an industrial road. This means the operator and/or any other worker riding in the vehicle may not put their head (or other body part) out through a window or any other opening while the vehicle is moving, unless it is essential to do so for a specific work\\nprocess. This requirement is not intended to prevent a worker riding in a passenger vehicle with an open cab, such as a convertible-style automobile.

Section 17.13 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nFor vehicles that do not have seat belt assemblies in every seating position, the seating capacity must be determined by the number of 41 cm (16 in) seat widths available, provided the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is\\nnot exceeded. Section 17.01 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\n\\\"gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)\\\"\\n means the manufacturer's maximum recommended weight for a vehicle, including the weight of the vehicle itself, fuel and other fluids, passengers, and all cargo;\\nPurpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance on estimating whether the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of a vehicle is exceeded. Background\\nEvery vehicle used on a public highway in British Columbia must comply with the laws, regulations, and standards administered by both the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) and Transport Canada (TC), as well\\nas the \\nRegulation\\n. Each vehicle has a GVWR designated by the manufacturer. This rating provides the maximum recommended weight for the vehicle including the weight of the vehicle plus its load; including passengers and cargo.

Some assistance in making this determination is available by consulting the Assigned Hazard Rating List under Part 3 of the OHS Guidelines which provides a hazard rating for\\nvarious occupations and industries. Types of tasks that may place workers at higher risk. Higher risk tasks may include working with machinery, working from heights, using explosives, or other activities where serious accidents or injuries have occurred in the past. Types of foreseeable interactions that may place workers at higher risk. Higher risk interactions may include repossessing furniture, issuing fines or other monetary penalties directly to individuals, working with aggressive or\\nunpredictable patients in a healthcare facility, or other interactions that may involve aggravated individuals.

Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to clarify riding restrictions as stated in section 17.4 of the \\nRegulation\\n. Standing\\nGenerally, standing will be allowed in large-capacity crew transportation vehicles not required by motor vehicle legislation to have seat belts. This applies, for example, to a city or transit type of bus, manufactured and equipped for this\\ntype of use. Even in such vehicles, standing should only be permitted in a controlled environment where speed, travel distance and transit time are low; for example, at a pulp mill construction site or on urban streets. Standing should not\\nbe permitted where highway speeds, long distances, or lengthy travel time are factors; for example, transport to a distant logging site on an industrial road. This means the operator and/or any other worker riding in the vehicle may not put their head (or other body part) out through a window or any other opening while the vehicle is moving, unless it is essential to do so for a specific work\\nprocess. This requirement is not intended to prevent a worker riding in a passenger vehicle with an open cab, such as a convertible-style automobile.

Section 17.13 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\nFor vehicles that do not have seat belt assemblies in every seating position, the seating capacity must be determined by the number of 41 cm (16 in) seat widths available, provided the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is\\nnot exceeded. Section 17.01 of the \\nRegulation\\n states:\\n\\\"gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)\\\"\\n means the manufacturer's maximum recommended weight for a vehicle, including the weight of the vehicle itself, fuel and other fluids, passengers, and all cargo;\\nPurpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance on estimating whether the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of a vehicle is exceeded. Background\\nEvery vehicle used on a public highway in British Columbia must comply with the laws, regulations, and standards administered by both the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) and Transport Canada (TC), as well\\nas the \\nRegulation\\n. Each vehicle has a GVWR designated by the manufacturer. This rating provides the maximum recommended weight for the vehicle including the weight of the vehicle plus its load; including passengers and cargo. When estimating the gross vehicle weight to determine whether the GVWR has been exceeded for the purposes of sections 17.13 and 17.5.1 of the \\nRegulation\\n, each passenger is assumed to weigh at least 68 kg (150 lbs).

Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to identify the acceptable standard for performing landslide risk assessments and developing written safe work procedures under section 26.18 of the \\nRegulation\\n. The guideline also clarifies that this work\\nmust be done by a qualified registered professional, with appropriate qualifications in landslide risk assessments. Landslide risk assessments as professional work\\nSection 26.18 requires that landslide risks are assessed, and that safe work procedures are developed to address those risks. While section 26.18 does not specify who may perform this work, the work falls within the professional\\npractices regulated under the \\nProfessional Governance Act\\n. This Act prohibits individuals other than qualified registered professionals from performing this work. The respective professional associations may place additional qualification requirements on their members to be able to perform landslide risk assessments. Where a WorkSafeBC prevention officer identifies that an individual is\\nperforming landslide risk assessments without being a qualified registered professional, or is otherwise unqualified, the prevention officer will refer that matter to the appropriate professional association. The prevention officer may also\\nwrite orders under section 26.18. Acceptable standards for landslide risk assessments and safe work procedures\\nEngineers & Geoscientists British Columbia (EGBC) and the Association of British Columbia Forest Professionals have developed the following three guidelines concerning landslides:\\nGuidelines for Managing Terrain Stability in the Forest Sector\\nGuidelines for Professional Services in the Forest Sector – Terrain Stability Assessments\\nGuidelines for Professional Services in the Forest Sector – Forest Roads\\nThe \\nGuidelines for Managing Terrain Stability in the Forest Sector\\n may be used to determine whether or not there is a risk of a landslide. Where a risk of a landslide is present, section 26.18 of the \\nRegulation\\n applies and the\\nGuidelines for Professional Services in the Forest Sector – Terrain Stability Assessments\\n (TSA Guideline) is an acceptable standard for performing the work under section 26.18. The \\nGuidelines for Professional Services in the Forest Sector – Forest Roads\\n may be of additional assistance for employers applying the TSA Guideline where the risk of a landslide is connected to road building activities.
