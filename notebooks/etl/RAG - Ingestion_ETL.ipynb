Editorial Revision January 1, 2009; Revised November 21, 2017; Editorial Revision consequential to August 22, 2022 Regulatory Amendment\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 1.1 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\"\\nRegulation\\n\") states, in part:\\n\"\\nprofessional engineer\\n\" means a person who is registered under the \\nProfessional Governance Act\\n as a professional engineer or professional engineer licensee;\\nPurpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide additional information about WorkSafeBC\\'s practices for engineering certificates.\\nEngineering certificate\\nWorkSafeBC prevention officers will treat as unacceptable any engineering certificate, approval, or design that does not comply with the regulations or an order or direction of WorkSafeBC, or a variance granted by WorkSafeBC.\\nThe situation may arise where there appears to be compliance with the \\nRegulation\\n, or with a variance granted by WorkSafeBC, but a prevention officer feels the engineering work is inadequate and could endanger a worker. In such\\ncases, the prevention officer will not reject the engineering certification, approval, or design without authorization from the prevention officer\\'s manager, and upon the recommendation of an engineer from the Engineering section of\\nWorkSafeBC.\\nThe Engineering section should be contacted for assistance in reviewing unclear, vague, and generally unprofessional engineering documents left on job sites for the purpose of compliance with the \\nRegulation\\n. The Engineering section may\\ninitiate a formal complaint to Engineers & Geoscientists British Columbia (EGBC). Each potential complaint will be assessed on an individual basis. Before a complaint is made, a member of the Engineering section will review the letter\\nand attachments for each complaint. The reviewer will be an engineer who has had no direct dealings with the person named in the complaint on the matter at issue. The reviewer will comment on the content, completeness, and apparent\\nreasonableness of the complaint.\\nAs an engineer is generally working in and contributing to the production of an industry, a prevention officer may write orders on the engineer, and the engineer\\'s firm, if the documents provided are inadequate and/or do not meet the\\nrequirements of the \\nRegulation\\n. Refer also to OHS Guideline \\nG20.78\\n regarding qualified registered professional\\'s certificates, which may include an engineer\\'s certificate for excavations.\\nG1.1(1) Resource Roads\\nIssued November 29, 2012; Editorial Revision April 6, 2020; Editorial Revision consequential to September 1, 2021 Regulatory Amendment\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 1.1(1) of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\"\\nRegulation\\n\") states, in part:\\n\"\\nresource road\\n\" means a road or portion of a road on Crown land, and includes a bridge, culvert, ford or other structure or work associated with the road, but does not include a highway within the meaning of the\\nTransportation Act\\n,\\nSections 1.1(2) – (4) of the \\nRegulation\\n state:\\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), in this Regulation, \\n\"workplace\"\\n does not include a resource road.\\n(3) A portion of a resource road is a workplace during any period within which the portion is being built, maintained, repaired, rehabilitated, stabilized, upgraded, removed or deactivated.\\n(4) Although a resource road does not constitute a workplace for the purposes of this Regulation, other than in one of the limited circumstances referred to in subsection (3), a reference to a workplace in this Regulation\\ncontinues to include a thing or place that constitutes a workplace even though that thing, or an activity or the result of an activity initiated or carried out at that place, is in whole or in part on a resource road.\\nPurpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to set out the circumstances under which a resource road is a workplace for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n.\\nResource roads - What are they?\\nResource roads are defined for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n as follows:\\na road or portion of a road on Crown land, and includes a bridge, culvert, ford or other structure or work associated with the road, but does not include a highway within the meaning of the \\nTransportation Act\\n;\\nMany industrial activities, in particular the development, management, and transportation of natural resources, are accessed through the use of resource roads. Resource roads are non-highway roads on Crown land constructed and\\nmaintained under a variety of legislation. These roads include forest service roads, forest roads, petroleum development roads, mineral exploration roads, and some industrial roads. Private roads are not considered resource roads.\\nResource road not a workplace \\nSection 1.1(2) states that, except in specific circumstances, a resource road is not a \"workplace\" for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n. The intent of this section is to clarify that resource roads are not to be treated as single workplaces\\ngiving rise to the obligations of a prime contractor or owner under \\nsections 24 and 25\\n of the \\nWorkers Compensation Act\\n (\"\\nAct\\n\"), and sections \\n26.1.1\\n (Prime contractor requirements for forestry operations) and \\n26.1.2\\n (Multiple-\\nemployer workplace) of the \\nRegulation\\n. That is, the activities of employers, workers, and others over the entire area of a resource road need not be coordinated by a prime contractor, nor does a prime contractor have to be designated\\nto establish and maintain a system or process that will ensure compliance with the OHS provisions of the \\nAct\\n and the \\nRegulation\\n for activities occurring over the entire road. Similarly, the requirements in sections \\n26.1.1\\n and \\n26.1.2\\n of the\\nRegulation\\n relating to coordination of multiple-employer workplaces in forestry operations will not apply with respect to resource roads.\\nIn addition, requirements that would otherwise relate to resource roads as a \"workplace\" will not apply. These requirements include a number of sections in part 26 relating to roads and road maintenance, notably sections \\n26.79\\n, 26.81,\\n26.82, 26.83, as well as more general obligations relating to the workplace.\\nAs noted above, while resource roads on Crown lands are not \"workplaces,\" private roads that are used for an industrial purpose continue to be considered \"workplaces.\" An example of private roads would be roads used to access\\nprivate managed forest land.\\nWhile section 1.1(1) exempts resource roads from the definition of workplace for the purposes of the \\nRegulation\\n, this exemption is not relevant to determining whether an injury, fatality, or illness incurred on a resource road or in\\nconnection to an activity on a resource road gives rise to a claim for compensation.\\nPortion of resource road as a workplace\\nSection 1.1(3) states that a portion of a resource road is a workplace during any period within which that portion is being built, maintained, repaired, rehabilitated, stabilized, upgraded, removed or deactivated. Where resource roads\\ncontain these smaller construction and maintenance workplaces, all relevant obligations in the \\nAct\\n and \\nRegulation\\n will apply to that workplace and any workplace party connected with the work. For clarity, these smaller construction or\\nmaintenance workplaces may give rise to the prime contractor obligations in section 24 of the \\nAct\\n with respect to that specific workplace, provided there are workers of more than one employer present. The prime contractor obligations\\nwill apply only to the smaller multiple-employer workplace within the resource road where the activities described in section 1.1(3) are taking place. In addition, \\nsection 26.80\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n, which states road construction must be\\ncarried out in a manner that does not create hazards from hung up or broken trees or limbs, will also apply.\\nWorkplaces on a resource road\\nIn addition to the exception in section 1.1(3), section 1.1(4) confirms that there may also be other work activities or workplaces that happen to occur on resource roads, but which do not render the whole resource road a workplace.\\nThe primary example of this type of work is the normal work related to the use of the resource road itself. The definition of \"workplace\" in section 13 of the Act includes in part, any \"vessel, vehicle or mobile equipment used by a worker\\nin work.\" Accordingly, though an entire resource road is not a single workplace, employers and workers who are travelling on the road (accessing workplaces, or engaging in hauling goods or equipment, etc.) or engaging in work\\nactivities relating to travel on the road (erforming vehicle maintenance, securing loads, etc.) in the course of their work will be subject to the requirements of the \\nAct\\n and the \\nRegulation\\n to carry out that work safely.\\nOther workplaces covered by section 1.1(4) include work that is undertaken on or near the resource road that incidentally occurs on or intersects with the resource road. This could include, for example, forestry yarding operations that\\nuse a resource road or a landing, and construction of works unrelated to the resource road, like buildings, hydro lines, or sewers and similar activities. As with the exception in section 1.1(3), these smaller workplaces may be multiple-\\nemployer workplaces if there are workers of more than one employer present, however the road itself will not be a single workplace.\\nObligations relating to the use of resource roads\\n1\\n. \\nEmployer obligations relating to road use\\nWhile resource roads are not \"workplaces,\" as noted above, vehicles or mobile equipment operated or occupied by workers on resource roads will be workplaces. Employers therefore have an obligation to ensure the health and\\nsafety of their workers using resource roads. This obligation entails a number of activities.\\na.

Is the risk to the worker reduced by the alternative? Section 5.57(2) of the \\nRegulation\\n prescribes that if substitution is not practicable for those substances listed in section 5.57(1) of the \\nRegulation\\n, the employer must implement an exposure control plan to ensure a worker's exposure is\\nkept as low as reasonably achievable to levels below the exposure limit. As indicated by section 5.57(3), the exposure control plan must meet the requirements of section 5.54. Refer to OHS Guidelines \\nG5.54-1 to G5.54-3\\n for further information on expectations for exposure control plans. G5.58 Protective policy\\nIssued August 1, 1999; Revised October 29, 2003; Editorial Revision October 2004; Editorial Revision January 1, 2009\\nRegulatory excerpt\\nSection 5.58 of the \\nOHS Regulation\\n (\\\"\\nRegulation\\n\\\") states:\\n(1) At any worksite where a worker is exposed to a substance which is identified in section 5.57(1) as an ACGIH reproductive toxin or an ACGIH sensitizer, the employer must develop policy and procedures appropriate\\nto the risk, which may include protective reassignment. (2) The policy and procedures required by subsection (1) must\\n(a) inform workers about the reproductive toxin and identify ways to minimize exposure to the toxin for a worker who has advised the employer of pregnancy or intent to conceive a child, and\\n(b) identify ways to eliminate or minimize exposure to a sensitizer for a worker who is or may be sensitized to that substance. Purpose of guideline\\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide additional information about protective reassignment and exposure control plans. Protective policy\\nThe policy and procedures may include protective reassignment, meaning that a worker may be relocated from a high-risk to a low-risk work area, based on the risk assessment carried out for the exposure potential. \\\"Exposure\\\" or routes of exposure in this section include inhalation, ingestion, and skin absorption.\",\n          \"Measures must be in compliance with the \\nRegulation\\n. 3\\n. The Table does not cover all aspects of asbestos controls required by the \\nRegulation\\n. Several examples are provided below. Air monitoring:\\n Air monitoring must be done if a worker may be exposed to asbestos, and in certain high-risk circumstances specified in the \\nRegulation\\n. Some procedures are prohibited:\\n Examples include pressure spraying to remove asbestos, and dry sweeping or using compressed air for cleanup. Procedures such as sanding of asbestos-contaminated flooring and similar\\nsurfaces should be avoided where possible, given the requirement in \\nsection 6.8\\n of the \\nRegulation\\n to prevent or minimize the release of airborne asbestos. Any sanding is considered to be high risk and requires a\\ncorresponding high level of control. Before starting work, all workers and supervisors must be properly trained:\\n Training is required on matters including the hazards of asbestos, the means of identifying asbestos-containing materials at the worksite, the\\ncorrect use and maintenance of personal protective equipment, the operation of required engineering controls, and the site-specific work procedures to be followed. Workers must be properly supervised.

Criteria for counting workers for the purpose of section 3.1(1)\\nIn determining the number of workers for the purpose of section 3.1(1), the following workers should be considered part of the employer\\'s workforce, regardless of how they or their employers define their status:\\nWorkers employed for more than one month\\nWorkers who are employed for less than one month, but have worked for the employer periodically. Note: Other sections of the \\nRegulation\\n and \\nWorkers Compensation Act\\n (\"\\nAct\\n\") also have requirements that relate to the number of workers. For criteria for counting workers for other requirements, refer to the following:\\nOHS Guideline \\nG3.16 First aid assessment\\nPrevention Manual\\n \\nPolicy Item P2-31-1: Joint Committees - When a Committee is Required\\nConsiderations for prevention officers when exercising their discretion under section 3.1(2) \\nIn addition to those employers who are required to initiate and maintain an OHS program under section 3.1(1), some other types of employers should also initiate and maintain health and safety programs. Section 3.1(2) provides that an\\nOHS program may be required in any workplace when, in the opinion of a prevention officer, such a program is necessary. A prevention officer who encounters a situation where all of the following conditions are present should consider requiring the employer to initiate and maintain an OHS program pursuant to section 3.1(2) of the \\nRegulation\\n:\\nThe employer has a workforce of less than 20 workers\\nThose workers are exposed to high risks\\nAn OHS program is essential to the health and safety of workers. In deciding whether to require an OHS program in the above situation, the prevention officer should consider whether such a program could be effectively initiated and maintained by the employer for each workplace where work is being\\nperformed for the benefit of that employer. Benefits of an OHS program for all workplaces\\nEven though an employer may not be required to initiate and maintain an OHS program, OHS programs can provide a number of benefits. For example, OHS programs enable an employer to control its occupational health and safety\\nrisks, improve health and safety performance, communicate its health and safety commitments and policies to staff, and provide a framework for attaining its health and safety goals and objectives. Further, OHS programs assist with\\nimplementation by delineating roles, responsibilities, and accountability for tasks, including checking and corrective action as the program evolves. A properly implemented OHS program can be expected to reduce injuries and the\\nassociated costs of disability and lost production hours. Occupational health and safety management systems\\nWhether for a small or large employer, occupational health and safety can be managed in the same way that the employer manages other facets of the organization\\'s activities (e.g., quality, production, environment, finances, customer\\nservice, etc.). An OHSMS can help organizations reduce or prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the workplace by providing a framework for corporate behaviour in OHS management. An OHSMS relies on commitment,\\nleadership, and worker participation to achieve its outcomes. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and other standard setting agencies have developed standards establishing minimum requirements and good practices for OHSMSs.

Masonry is often \\nselected for walls that require a high level of fire \\nresistance, sound isolation, or durability. The engineering drawings for a building typically \\ndetail how masonry walls are to be permanently \\nsupported by the other components of the building \\nstructure. However, these engineering drawings don’t \\nusually address how masonry walls are to be \\nsupported during construction. Contractors must ensure that masonry walls are \\nsupported adequately during construction, \\nparticularly when it comes to lateral stability. During \\nconstruction, lateral support of a masonry wall is \\ntypically achieved by one or both of the following:\\n• Installing permanent supports as wall construction \\nprogresses\\n• Restraining the wall with temporary braces\\nWhat is the hazard? If sufficient lateral support of a masonry wall is not \\nmaintained during construction, the wall could \\ncollapse catastrophically due to its low resistance to \\nlateral loads such as wind.

The wall was non-load \\nbearing and more than 15 metres (50 feet) high. Except at the wall base, no temporary or permanent \\nsupports had been installed to laterally brace the wall, so the wall had very low resistance to lateral \\nloads such as wind. There were no injuries, but one neighbouring building was destroyed, and two \\nothers were badly damaged.

Lateral stability is a concern for all masonry walls. Types of masonry walls that are particularly at risk  \\nof lateral instability during construction include:\\n• Load-bearing walls (i.e., walls that vertically \\nsupport floor or roof members) with large \\ndistances between points of lateral support. The \\nwalls of gymnasiums, warehouses, and similar \\nstructures sometimes fit into this category. • Non-load-bearing walls (i.e., walls that do not \\nvertically support floor or roof members) that are \\nmultiple storeys tall. Examples include firewalls at \\nthe perimeters of new buildings. The masonry wall \\ndescribed at the start of this bulletin was this type \\nof wall. How to prevent masonry wall collapses\\nMasonry contractors\\nDevelop safe work procedures that specify  \\nhow masonry walls will be supported during \\nconstruction. This may require written instructions \\nfrom a professional engineer and input from the \\nprime contractor. These procedures should answer \\nquestions such as the following:\\n• Who will install the permanent supports from  \\nthe masonry wall to the building structure? Best \\npractice is to document who is responsible for  \\nthe permanent supports. • When and where will the permanent supports  \\nbe installed? • Are the permanent supports adequate for the \\nforces imposed during construction? • Is temporary bracing of the masonry wall required? • If temporary bracing is required, what does it \\nconsist of?

Masonry is often \\nselected for walls that require a high level of fire \\nresistance, sound isolation, or durability. The engineering drawings for a building typically \\ndetail how masonry walls are to be permanently \\nsupported by the other components of the building \\nstructure. However, these engineering drawings don\\u2019t \\nusually address how masonry walls are to be \\nsupported during construction. Contractors must ensure that masonry walls are \\nsupported adequately during construction, \\nparticularly when it comes to lateral stability. During \\nconstruction, lateral support of a masonry wall is \\ntypically achieved by one or both of the following:\\n\\u2022 Installing permanent supports as wall construction \\nprogresses\\n\\u2022 Restraining the wall with temporary braces\\nWhat is the hazard? If sufficient lateral support of a masonry wall is not \\nmaintained during construction, the wall could \\ncollapse catastrophically due to its low resistance to \\nlateral loads such as wind. A collapse of this type \\nWS 2019-02WorkSafeBC Prevention Information Line: 604.276.3100  \\nor toll-free 1.888.621.SAFE (7233)page 1 of 2\\nBC\\nC\\nD\\nAF\\nENot long after work had finished for the day on a building construction site, a concrete block masonry \\nwall at the edge of the building collapsed outward onto two adjacent properties. The wall was non-load \\nbearing and more than 15 metres (50 feet) high. Except at the wall base, no temporary or permanent \\nsupports had been installed to laterally brace the wall, so the wall had very low resistance to lateral \\nloads such as wind. There were no injuries, but one neighbouring building was destroyed, and two \\nothers were badly damaged. This bulletin explains the potential hazards of masonry walls and discusses \\nways to reduce the risk of a collapse. The masonry wall collapse incident\\nA Non-load-bearing masonry wall of new building\\nB Structural wall of new building\\nC Buildings damaged by falling masonry\\nD Building destroyed by falling masonry\\nE Paths of falling masonry blocks during wall collapse\\nF No lateral supports installed between masonry wall and \\nstructural wallpage 2 of 2could result in serious injuries or fatalities, as well as \\ndamage to adjacent structures or equipment. Lateral stability is a concern for all masonry walls. Types of masonry walls that are particularly at risk  \\nof lateral instability during construction include:\\n\\u2022 Load-bearing walls (i.e., walls that vertically \\nsupport floor or roof members) with large \\ndistances between points of lateral support. The \\nwalls of gymnasiums, warehouses, and similar \\nstructures sometimes fit into this category. \\u2022 Non-load-bearing walls (i.e., walls that do not \\nvertically support floor or roof members) that are \\nmultiple storeys tall. Examples include firewalls at \\nthe perimeters of new buildings. The masonry wall \\ndescribed at the start of this bulletin was this type \\nof wall. How to prevent masonry wall collapses\\nMasonry contractors\\nDevelop safe work procedures that specify  \\nhow masonry walls will be supported during \\nconstruction. This may require written instructions \\nfrom a professional engineer and input from the \\nprime contractor. These procedures should answer \\nquestions such as the following:\\n\\u2022 Who will install the permanent supports from  \\nthe masonry wall to the building structure? Best \\npractice is to document who is responsible for  \\nthe permanent supports. \\u2022 When and where will the permanent supports  \\nbe installed? \\u2022 Are the permanent supports adequate for the \\nforces imposed during construction? \\u2022 Is temporary bracing of the masonry wall required? \\u2022 If temporary bracing is required, what does it \\nconsist of? When will it be installed?\",\n          \"Who will \\ninstall it?\",\n          \"At what point can it be removed? \\u2022 What is the maximum height of masonry wall  \\nthat can be built above a line of temporary bracing \\nand/or permanent supports? Ensure workers are trained in the safe work \\nprocedures and effectively supervised.Ensure regular inspections are conducted to confirm \\nthat temporary bracing and permanent supports for \\nmasonry walls are installed as required. Owners and prime contractors\\nEnsure safe work procedures are in place specifying \\nhow masonry walls will be supported. Coordinate work activities, especially the installation \\nof temporary bracing and permanent supports,  \\nto prevent the development of unsafe conditions.

Breathing in this fine dust can cause a serious lung disease called silicosis, which is characterized by scarring and thickening of the lungs, and can result in death. Protecting workers when working with fibre cement board products\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThis document will help contractors develop an exposure control plan (ECP) for work involving the cutting of fibre cement board. The ECP is a requirement of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation and sets out a detailed approach to protecting workers from harmful exposure to crystalline silica dust. Contractors can use this document as a template and add specific details regarding their specific work practices. This document covers the points you need to follow to protect workers from harmful exposure.\",\n          \"It is important to follow all the points or use equally effective measures. Fibre board cutting tools/equipment:\\nShears\\n* Stationary shears work well for larger jobs with high cutting rates. * Manual production shears work well for long angle cuts (gable ends). These tools are portable and don\\u2019t require electric or air power. * Handheld shears (snippers) are available in electric or pneumatic designs. Some can cut straight lines, while others can be used for wide-\\nradius work, scroll work, or circles. * Shears can only cut one thickness of siding and can't cut 1.9 cm (3/4 in.) trim boards. For this, a circular saw works best. Circular saws\\n   * A number of equipment manufacturers make saws specially designed for cutting fibre cement board. * These tools are designed to stand up to abrasive silica dust and the dust loading generated during this type of work. For example, these tools have dust-proof bearings and a switch with a dust-proof casing. * When saws are used, a dust collection system is required. Such a system includes an industrial vacuum cleaner designed for use with silica dust and equipped with a HEPA filtering system. * These systems rely on attachments including shrouds (suction casings that surround the cutting blade), hose attachments, and vacuum cleaners. The dust is collected within the shroud and drawn into the vacuum, where it is filtered and discharged. * Each tool has a different approach to collecting and/or controlling dust. Score & snap knife\\n   * Used to scribe the back of the cement board and snap it over a 2X4. Cut this way, siding breaks cleanly, as long as you scribe it uniformly. * Crews using this method can be as productive as crews using other cutting methods. Equipment tips\\n   * Invest in good quality equipment and keep it well maintained. * Well-designed and maintained equipment significantly reduces dust and lasts longer between replacement and maintenance. * A variety of specially designed equipment is available for cutting fibre cement board. Respirator program\\nEmployers whose workers wear respirators are required to develop and implement a respirator protection program. The WorkSafeBC publication Breathe Safer provides guidance for developing this program. Additional information\\nThe following WorkSafeBC publications are available from WorkSafeBC.com. * Breathe Safer booklet\\n   * Toolbox Meeting Guides\\n   * Silica awareness\\n   * Silicosis\\n   * Silica safety when cutting fibre cement board\\n\\n\\nFor information about workplace health and safety, employers and workers can call the WorkSafeBC information line at \\n604 276-3100. Useful links\\n   * HSE leaflets (silica and construction) can be downloaded free from the HSE web site: www.hse.gov.uk/pubns\\n   * NIOSH publications are available at no charge at www.cdc.gov/niosh. Search 'silica' and 'construction'. Contractor company information\\n   * Name\\n   * Address\\n   * Contact information (names and phone numbers)\\n\\n\\nWorksite information\\n   * Project name\\n   * Address\\n\\n\\nHealth hazards from silica exposure\\n   * Long-term exposure to airborne crystalline silica can cause a disabling, sometimes fatal lung disease called silicosis. * When the dust is inhaled deep into the lungs, microscopic particles of silica can cause scar tissue to form in the lung tissue, which restricts the lungs\\u2019 ability to extract oxygen from the air.\",\n          \"* Knowing how to report exposure incidents. Risk identification and assessment\\n   * Fibre cement board can contain up to 90% crystalline silica. * Cutting fibre cement board without the use of proper dust controls and personal protective equipment can expose workers to airborne respirable crystalline silica levels above the exposure limit listed in the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation. Exposure limit\\n   * The occupational exposure limit (OEL) for respirable crystalline (including quartz) is 0.025 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/m3). * As crystalline silica is linked to lung cancer, the ALARA principle also applies, and workplace exposures will be reduced to levels as low as reasonably achievable. Silica dust control\\n   * The Regulation requires employers to select silica dust controls based on the following hierarchy:\\n   * Substitution\\n   * Engineering\\n   * Administrative controls\\n   * Personal protective equipment\\n   * Use of respirators as a primary control is not acceptable when other methods are available and practical. Acceptable control methods for cutting fibre cement board\\n   * WorkSafeBC has reviewed the various cutting methods available for fibre cement board and have determined that the methods that appear in the following table are acceptable, provided that the respirator selection is adhered to. * The following control options will be used to eliminate or reduce the risk to workers from the hazards of silica dust exposure:\\n\\n\\nCutting method/tools\\n\\tWork location\\n\\tRespirator type\\n\\tFibre cement shears\\n\\tOutdoors\\n\\tNone required\\n\\tFibre cement shears\\n\\tIndoors\\n\\tN95 respirator\\n\\tScore and snap knife\\n\\tOutdoors or indoors\\n\\tNone required\\n\\tDust-reducing circular saw connected to HEPA vacuum extraction\\n\\tOutdoors\\n\\tHalf-face or full-face respirator with N100 filters\\n\\tDust-reducing circular saw connected to HEPA vacuum extraction\\n\\tIndoors\\n\\tHalf-face or full-face respirator with N100 filters\\n\\t\\n\\nRespiratory protective equipment\\n   * Each worker will be fit-tested if a respirator is required. * When the worker notices a notable resistance to breathing, the respirator filters must be replaced. * Respirators will be used, cleaned, and stored in accordance with the respiratory protection program. Other personal protective equipment\\n   * Workers will wear approved safety glasses and hearing protection when cutting cement board. * Workers will wear washable work coveralls. Safe work planning\\n   * Select one or more of the cutting methods described in the table above. * Select a cutting location well away from active work areas. * Inspect all dust control equipment/tools available on site to make sure they are in good working order. * Use and maintain all tools as specified by the manufacturer. * Review the safe workplan and work procedures with workers involved in cutting fibre cement board. * Establish a barrier around the cutting work zone to restrict access to unprotected workers. * Provide the general contractor with a copy of the site\\u2019s silica exposure control plan and safe work procedures. * Make sure that workers inspect their respirators before start-up. * Monitor dust release from your equipment during cutting. When tools/equipment are working properly, very little dust should be visible in the air. Stop work if excessive dust is observed. * Vacuum or wet wipe any settled dust from floors and work surfaces (do not use compressed air). Vacuums will need to be cleaned and the filters changed on a regular basis. Health surveillance \\n      * Workers who are regularly exposed to silica dust will receive regular medical examinations from their family physicians. These examinations may include chest x-rays. * Workers will report any symptoms of silica exposure for tracking and investigation. Workers will be trained in the following:\\n      * The risk of exposure to silica, and the signs and symptoms of silica disease\\n      * Safe work procedures to be followed\\n      * Proper use of all required equipment and tools\\n      * Proper use of respirators and other personal protective equipment\\n      * How to seek first aid\\n      * How to report an exposure to silica dust\\n\\n\\nAnnual review\\n      * This ECP will be reviewed at least annually and updated as necessary by the employer, in consultation with the workplace health and safety committee or the worker health and safety representative.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_index\",\n      \"properties\":
